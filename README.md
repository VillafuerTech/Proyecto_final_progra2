It's a program that simulates the process of collecting stickers and organizing them into albums. The code includes a utility function to check if a file exists and a class definition for an `Album`.

The `fileExists` function takes a filename as a string and attempts to open it as an input file stream. If the file can be opened successfully, the function returns true, indicating that the file exists. Otherwise, it returns false.

The `Album` class represents a collection of stickers organized into albums. The class has a constructor that takes the number of albums as an argument and calculates the total number of packs and stickers based on this number. It also calls two methods, `GenerateStickers` and `GeneratePacks`, which are not defined in the provided code but presumably generate the stickers and packs for the albums.

The `BackupDuplicates` method of the `Album` class writes the duplicate stickers in the album to a file named "duplicates.txt". It iterates over the `album` map (which is not shown in the provided code but presumably maps sticker numbers to their counts in the album) and writes the sticker number and count to the file for each sticker that appears more than once in the album.

The `BackupAlbum` method of the `Album` class writes the stickers in the album to a file named "album.txt". It iterates over the numbers from 1 to 25 and writes each number to the file if it appears in the `album` map. This suggests that there are 25 possible stickers that can be collected.

Note that both `BackupDuplicates` and `BackupAlbum` methods check if the file can be opened successfully before attempting to write to it. If the file cannot be opened, an error message is printed to the standard error stream.
