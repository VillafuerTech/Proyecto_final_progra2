This C++ code is a part of a larger program that simulates the management of a sticker album. The user is asked to input the number of albums to produce, and an Album object is created with that number.

The main part of the code is a do-while loop that presents a menu of options to the user and performs different actions based on the user's choice. The options are:

Display the number of available packs. This is hardcoded to 50 in the code.
Open a pack. The user is asked to input the number of the pack to open, and the OpenPack method of the Album object is called with that number.
Show the album. The ShowAlbum method of the Album object is called.
Show duplicate stickers. The ShowDuplicates method of the Album object is called.
Show missing stickers. The ShowMissingStickers method of the Album object is called.
Finish the album. The Finish method of the Album object is called.
Restart the album. The Album object is reinitialized with the original number of albums.
If the user inputs a number that does not correspond to any of the options, a message is displayed indicating that the option is not valid. The loop continues until the user chooses to finish the album or restart it.
